        "So, what is a condition? In the end, it is something that is either `True` or `False`, in other word, a condition always results in a boolean value. In principal, you could use `True` or `False`, when a condition is required. However, this  not flexible, i.e. `True` is always true. More sophisticated conditions can be expressed by comparing the content of variables with a given value. For example, there is an integer variable `age`. Then the value can be either equal to 18 or not equal. So checking for *is the value of age equal to 18* can either be `True` or `False`. There are a number of comparison operators, which can be used for both numerical data types and string data types. In the former case, the usual order of numbers is used, in the latter case, the alphabetic order is taken.\n",

        "a comparison using these operators is always a `Boolean` value. As already explained, the only possible `Boolean` values\n",

        "It is important to emphasize the difference between `=` and `==`. If there is one equal sign, the statement is an *assignment*. A value is assigned to a variable. The assignment has no return value, it is neither true or false. If there are two equal signs, it is a comparison. The values on both sides of the `==` are unchanged. However, the comparison leads to a value, namely `True` or `False`.\n",
